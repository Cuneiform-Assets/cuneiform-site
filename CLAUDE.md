# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation and content repository for Cuneiform Assets Ltd., a digital asset company based in the British Virgin Islands. The repository contains company documentation, web copy, and materials related to blockchain technology and token reward campaigns, particularly focused on the BABY token for the Babylon Genesis chain.

## Repository Structure

- `OVERVIEW.md` - Comprehensive company overview including mission, values, business model, and regulatory standards
- `WEBCOPIES.md` - Website copy describing company purpose, services, and target audience
- `.gitignore` - Standard Node.js gitignore configuration suggesting this may evolve into a web project

## Development Notes

This repository currently contains only documentation files. The presence of a Node.js-style `.gitignore` suggests future development of a web application or site may be planned. When working with this repository:

- Maintain professional, compliant tone in all content
- Ensure any web development follows regulatory requirements mentioned in documentation
- Consider international compliance requirements when implementing user-facing features
- Respect the company's ethical standards around transparency and regulatory adherence

## Future Development Considerations

If this evolves into a web application:
- Implement geo-blocking for restricted jurisdictions (US, Canada, Australia, sanctioned regions)
- Include appropriate legal disclaimers and compliance notices
- Consider KYC/AML requirements for any user interaction features
- Maintain transparency in any token-related functionality
