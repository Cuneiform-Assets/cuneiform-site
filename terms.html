                                <p>You might want to interact with the Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol, the Babylon time-stamping protocol, and Babylon Genesis and its native token BABY (the "Babylon Protocols"), and other publicly available protocols and networks such as the Bitcoin protocol (together with the Babylon Protocols, the "Protocols"). Anyone with internet access and technical sophistication can interact directly with the Protocols.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Know Your Protocols.</strong> By interacting with the Protocols, you can access their functionalities, for example, to self-authorize a staking transaction handled by the Protocols. You should research and understand the Protocols before using them. You can review their software source codes that are freely licensed to the public and available at GitHub. We do not operate or control the Protocols, or their validators or finality providers.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Bring Your Own Wallet.</strong> You will need to use a third-party crypto wallet provider if you want to utilize some of the Protocols in connection with Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or blockchain tokens ("Digital Assets"). You are solely responsible for your custody of your Digital Assets and the cryptographic private keys to the Digital Asset wallets you hold. You should never share your private keys, wallet credentials, or seed phrase with anyone. Our support for or announcements of compatibility with wallet applications, devices, or other third-party applications is not an endorsement or recommendation of such applications or devices, or a warranty, guarantee, promise, or assurance regarding their fitness or security. We are not and will not be responsible or liable for any claims, damages, losses or liabilities whatsoever resulting from the compromise of your wallet or your Digital Assets or their loss.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Fees.</strong> We do not collect any compensation from you for use of the Website in accordance with these Terms. However, you will need to pay network fees to have transaction messages delivered through the Protocol and results recorded on the appropriate blockchain.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Your Keys, Your Coins.</strong> The Website is provided by us and the Babylon Protocols were developed by one or more of our company affiliates and paid licensors (each and collectively, a "Provider") as well as a community of contributors. Provider is not an agent or intermediary. Provider does not store, have access to or control over any of your Digital Assets, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of yours. Provider is not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on your behalf. Provider does not hold or have the ability to purchase, sell or trade any of your Digital Assets. All transactions relating to the Protocol are executed and recorded solely through your interactions with the respective blockchains. The interactions are not under the control of or affiliated with Provider.</p>

                            <div class="section-txt">
                                <p>You acknowledge, agree to, and assume the following risks and matters:</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Digital Assets Risk.</strong> Digital Assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, carry significant risks that users must fully understand before engaging in any transactions. These risks include, but are not limited to, extreme price volatility, potential loss of access due to forgotten passwords or misplaced private keys, cybersecurity threats such as hacking or phishing, and the possibility of irreversible transactions. Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape for Digital Assets is complex and evolving, meaning that laws governing their use, taxation, and compliance obligations may change unexpectedly and vary by jurisdiction. Fraud, scams, and market manipulation are also prevalent concerns in the Digital Asset space.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Protocol Risks.</strong> The Protocols, including Babylon Genesis, are developing decentralized protocols and the economic mechanisms described on the Website are subject to change based on decisions made by the larger community of builders and users. The Protocols rely upon third parties to adopt and implement software and protocols as users and contributors of the Protocols. They also rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to develop, supply and otherwise support them. There is no assurance or guarantee that such third parties will continue to participate in the Protocol or that the Protocol will continue to function as intended.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Technology Risks.</strong> Risks related to blockchain technology in general and Babylon Genesis in particular may impact the usefulness of Babylon Genesis, and, in turn, the utility or value of BABY. The software and hardware, technology and technical concepts and theories applicable to Babylon Genesis and BABY are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that Babylon Genesis will achieve any specific level of functionality or success, nor that the underlying technology will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
