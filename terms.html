                                <p>You might want to interact with the Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol, the Babylon time-stamping protocol, and Babylon Genesis and its native token BABY (the "Babylon Protocols"), and other publicly available protocols and networks such as the Bitcoin protocol (together with the Babylon Protocols, the "Protocols"). Anyone with internet access and technical sophistication can interact directly with these Protocols.</p>

                                <p><strong>Know Your Protocols.</strong> By interacting with the Protocols, you can access their functionalities, for example, to self-authorize a staking transaction handled by the Protocols. You should research and understand the Protocols before using them. You can review their software source codes that are freely licensed to the public and available at GitHub. We do not operate or control the Protocols, or their validators or finality providers.</p>

                                <p><strong>Bring Your Own Wallet.</strong> You will need to use a third-party crypto wallet provider if you want to utilize some of the Protocols in connection with Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or blockchain tokens ("Digital Assets"). You are solely responsible for your custody of your Digital Assets and the cryptographic private keys to the Digital Asset wallets you hold. You should never share your private keys, wallet credentials, or seed phrase with anyone. Our support for or announcements of compatibility with wallet applications, devices, or other third-party applications is not an endorsement or recommendation of such applications or devices, or a warranty, guarantee, promise, or assurance regarding their fitness or security.

                                <p>You acknowledge, agree to, and assume the following risks and matters:</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Digital Assets Risk.</strong> Digital Assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, carry significant risks that users must fully understand before engaging in any transactions. These risks include, but are not limited to, extreme price volatility, potential loss of access due to forgotten passwords or misplaced private keys, cybersecurity threats such as hacking or phishing, and the possibility of irreversible transactions. Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape for Digital Assets is complex and evolving, meaning that laws governing their use, taxation, and compliance obligations may change unexpectedly and vary by jurisdiction. Fraud, scams, and market manipulation are also prevalent concerns in the Digital Asset space.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Protocol Risks.</strong> The Protocols, including Babylon Genesis, are developing decentralized protocols and the economic mechanisms described on the Website are subject to change based on decisions made by the larger community of builders and users. The Protocols rely upon third parties to adopt and implement software and protocols as users and contributors of the Protocols. They also rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to develop, supply and otherwise support them. There is no assurance or guarantee that such third parties will continue to participate in the Protocol or that the Protocol will continue to function as intended.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Technology Risks.</strong> Risks related to blockchain technology in general and Babylon Genesis in particular may impact the usefulness of Babylon Genesis, and, in turn, the utility or value of BABY. The software and hardware, technology and technical concepts and theories applicable to Babylon Genesis and BABY are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that Babylon Genesis will achieve any specific level of functionality or success, nor that the underlying technology will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>

                            <div class="section-txt">
                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.1. PLEASE READ THIS CLAUSE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.</h4>

                                <p>Please read the arbitration provisions in this Section 6 of these Terms of Use carefully (the "Arbitration Agreement"). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with us and all of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the "Cuneiform Parties") and limits the manner in which you can seek relief.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.2. Informal Dispute Resolution</h4>

                                <p>There might be instances when a dispute arises between you and the Cuneiform Parties arising from or related to the Website or any information provided through the website ("Dispute"). If that happens, you may send a written Notice of Dispute by email to us at legal@cuneiformassets.io ("Notice"). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the Dispute and set forth the specific relief sought.</p>

                                <p>If we do not resolve the Dispute set out in the notice within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of receipt, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both of us agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.3. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</h4>

                                <p>All unresolved disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to any information provided through the website or any other acts or omissions for which you may claim that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any dispute, claim, or controversy as to arbitrability, will be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration ("LCIA") under the LCIA Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the filing for arbitration of such dispute. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.4. Additional Terms of the Arbitration</h4>

                                <p>The following terms apply to any arbitration proceedings commenced under this Agreement:</p>
                                <ul style="margin: 15px 0; padding-left: 30px; color: #ccc;">
                                    <li>The arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator, unless either party requests three arbitrators, in which case it will be held before three neutral arbitrators.</li>
                                    <li>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.</li>
                                    <li>The arbitration will be held in the Cayman Islands and the Cayman Islands will be deemed the 'seat of arbitration'.</li>
                                    <li>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
                                    <li>Any judgment or award made or rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary.</li>
                                    <li>The parties will keep the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose any information regarding the arbitration to any third party except as follows. The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the "Confidential Information") will not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the ICC, the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration, or as necessary to enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings, or as required by law. This confidentiality provision will survive termination of these Terms of Use and of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms of Use.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.5. Other Terms</h4>

                                <p>If applicable law allows the enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement only if you have an opportunity to opt out of these arbitration provisions within a certain amount of time after you accept these Terms of Use, then you have 30 days from your first use of the Website in which to opt out of such arbitration terms by sending an email to us. This email should notify us that you wish to opt out and provide us with your full name, entity name if you have one, and jurisdiction.</p>

                                <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Arbitration Agreement at any time. Any such changes will take effect immediately upon us posting the revised Agreement to the Website. If you do not agree with the changes, you may opt out within 30 days of the change by sending written notice to us. Otherwise, your continued use of the services will constitute your acceptance of the updated Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                                <p>To the extent you reject any future changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes).</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.6. Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver</h4>

                                <p>You agree to bring all disputes or claims arising from or connected to the Website or any information provided through it in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding.</p>

                                <p>Further, if any Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

                                <p>Further, if for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration: (a) you and we irrevocably waive the right to demand a trial by jury, and (b) you and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Cayman Islands and any courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.7. Exclusions</h4>

                                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing agreement to arbitrate, you or we may bring any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #fff; margin-top: 20px;">6.8. Applicable law</h4>

                                <p>These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws. Except as expressly set forth herein, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (as defined below) will be the courts located in the Cayman Islands, and you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
