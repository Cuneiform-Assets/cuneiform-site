            <h3>14.16. Force Majeure Events</h3>
            <p>The Issuer Group shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any event beyond the Issuer Group's reasonable control, including but not limited to flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, pandemic, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of Governmental Authorities, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.</p>

                <h2 id="schedule2">SCHEDULE 2 - RISK DISCLOSURES: CERTAIN RISK FACTORS</h2>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>ACQUIRING TOKENS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. PROSPECTIVE CLAIMANTS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS DESCRIBED HEREIN, TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE AIRDROP TERMS AND THE INFORMATION MATERIALS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION TO REGISTER FOR THE AIRDROP OR RECEIVE TOKENS.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Key Risk Factors Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reliance on Developers:</strong> The Issuer may enter into service agreements with software developers who will provide services with respect to the development and distribution of the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Wallet Incompatibility:</strong> Your cryptocurrency wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the receipt, storage, and transfer of the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks Associated with the Blockchain Protocols:</strong> Any malfunction, breakdown, abandonment, unintended function, unexpected functioning of, or attack on the protocol upon which the Tokens are issued may have an adverse effect on the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks Associated with your Credentials:</strong> Any third party that gains access to or learns of your wallet login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of your Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action:</strong> Cryptographic Technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Platforms:</strong> Following the distribution of the Tokens, it is possible that alternative applications or platforms could be established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Token Generation Risk and Risk of Insufficient Interest:</strong> There are no guarantees as to the timing of the Tokens being integrated into the Platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Operating History:</strong> The Issuer has no operating history and will be operating in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk that the Platform Will Not Meet Expectations:</strong> The Platform presently is under continued development and may undergo significant changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Litigation and Third-Party Claims:</strong> From time to time, third parties may assert claims against the Issuer, its developers, and/or its underlying technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Value of the Tokens Will Be Affected by the Success of the Platform:</strong> Because the Tokens are intended for use on the Platform, a failure by the owner of the Platform to successfully develop and/or maintain the Platform would negatively affect the value of the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-Term Viability of Cryptoassets:</strong> Cryptoassets, including those like the Tokens, are a new and relatively untested product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Further Innovations in the Cryptoasset Industry:</strong> The development and acceptance of the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of, and transactions in, cryptoassets is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate and predict.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inability to Fund Development or Maintenance:</strong> The Issuer may not be able to fund development of the Tokens, while the owner of the Platform may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it was intended.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks from Taxation:</strong> The tax characterization of the Tokens is uncertain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Theft and Hacking:</strong> Smart contracts, software applications, and the Platform may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Platform:</strong> The Platform consists, at least in part, of open-source software that may be based on other open-source software.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography:</strong> Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Platform protocol.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Platform:</strong> While the Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of an Illiquid Market for Tokens:</strong> There may never be any marketplace for Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Dissolution of the Platform:</strong> It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, the Platform may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to maintain commercial or legal viability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Malfunction in the Platform:</strong> It is possible that the Platform malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including one that results in the loss of the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Arising from Lack of Governance Rights:</strong> To the extent the Tokens confer no governance functionality or only limited governance rights with respect to the Platform, substantially all decisions involving the Platform can be made by those with such governance capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks Associated with Incomplete Information:</strong> You will not have full access to all the information relevant to the Issuer, the Tokens, and/or the Platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Fiduciary Relationship:</strong> The holders of Tokens will not be in any fiduciary, partnership, trustee, agency, or similar relationship with the Issuer Group.</li>
                    <li><strong>Changes to Token and Platform for Legal Compliance:</strong> In order to seek compliance with any laws, the Issuer may in its sole and absolute discretion take such steps as it considers necessary or convenient to comply with such matters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation Risk:</strong> Regulation of Cryptographic Technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently underdeveloped and is likely to evolve rapidly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Representation by Legal Counsel:</strong> The legal counsel representing the issuer as to matters of BVI law does not represent any current or prospective investors with respect to an investment in the Tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Abandonment / Lack of Success:</strong> The Tokens and Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, funding, commercial success or prospects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Associated with Markets for Tokens:</strong> Any value which anyone ascribe to the Tokens may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unanticipated Risks:</strong> Cryptographic Technologies are a relatively new and comparatively untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed herein, there are risks that the Issuer cannot anticipate.</li>
                </ul>
