Applicable law may permit you to opt out of these arbitration provisions within a brief amount of time after you accept these Terms. In either case, the provisions of Section 17, “governing law”, will apply.

We may change, add, remove, or modify these Terms including any provisions in these Terms, at any time in our sole discretion. If we do, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms were last revised. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes, and we encourage you to do so regularly.

1. THE PROTOCOLS

You might want to interact with the Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol, the Babylon time-stamping protocol, and Babylon Genesis and its native token BABY (the “Babylon Protocols”), and other publicly available protocols and networks such as the Bitcoin protocol (together with the Babylon Protocols, the ”Protocols”). Anyone with internet access and technical sophistication can interact directly with the Protocols. 

Know Your Protocols. By interacting with the Protocols, you can access their functionalities, for example, to self-authorize a staking transaction handled by the Protocols. You should research and understand the Protocols before using them. You can review their software source codes that are freely licensed to the public and available at GitHub. We do not operate or control the Protocols, or their validators or finality providers.

Bring Your Own Wallet. You will need to use a third-party crypto wallet provider if you want to utilize some of the Protocols in connection with Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or blockchain tokens (“Digital Assets”). You are solely responsible for your custody of your Digital Assets and the cryptographic private keys to the Digital Asset wallets you hold. You should never share your private keys, wallet credentials, or seed phrase with anyone. Our support for or announcements of compatibility with wallet applications, devices, or other third-party applications is not an endorsement or recommendation of such applications or devices, or a warranty, guarantee, promise, or assurance regarding their fitness or security. We are not and will not be responsible or liable for any claims, damages, losses or liabilities whatsoever resulting from the compromise of your wallet or your Digital Assets or their loss.

Fees. We do not collect any compensation from you for use of the Website in accordance with these Terms. However, you will need to pay network fees to have transaction messages delivered through the Protocol and results recorded on the appropriate blockchain. 

Your Keys, Your Coins. The Website is provided by us and the Babylon Protocols were developed by one or more of our company affiliates and paid licensors (each and collectively, a “Provider”) as well as a community of contributors.  Provider is not an agent or intermediary. Provider does not store, have access to or control over any of your Digital Assets, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of yours. Provider is not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on your behalf. Provider does not hold or have the ability to purchase, sell or trade any of your Digital Assets. All transactions relating to the Protocol are executed and recorded solely through your interactions with the respective blockchains. The interactions are not under the control of or affiliated with Provider.

The Interface. If you are interested in using the staking interface found here, it is provided by a different company and subject to different terms of use, found here. Nothing in these Terms are intended to nor will be read to modify, diminish, or supersede any provisions set forth in those terms of use that confer greater protection or benefit to the rights, limitations of liability, or remedies of Provider or any of the Provider Parties (as defined below).

The API. If you are interested in using the API described here, it is provided by a different company and subject to different terms under the API Access License found here. Nothing in these Terms are intended to nor will be read to modify, diminish, or supersede any provision set forth in the API Access License that confers greater protection or benefit to the rights, limitations of liability, or remedies of any of the Provider Parties (as defined below).

The Airdrop. If you are participating in the BABY Airdrop described here, it is provided by a different company and subject to different terms found here. Nothing in these Terms are intended to nor will be read to modify, diminish, or supersede any provision set forth in the Airdrop Terms that confers greater protection or benefit to the rights, limitations of liability, or remedies of any of the Provider Parties (as defined below). “Website” as used in these Terms does not include the airdrop registration portal found at airdrop.babylon.foundation.

Unless otherwise noted, all text, graphics, user interfaces, visual interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, sounds, music, artwork and computer code (collectively, ”Content”), including but not limited to the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, “look and feel” and arrangement of such Content, contained in the Website is owned, controlled or licensed by or to us and is protected by trade dress, copyright, patent and trademark laws, and various other intellectual property rights. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, no part of the Website and no Content may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted or distributed in any way to any other computer, server, website or other medium for publication or distribution or for any commercial enterprise, without our express prior written consent.

Our trade names and logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of ours. All other names and logos on the Website are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners, where applicable. References to any third party-owned trademarks on or in the Website are for informational purposes only and are not intended to indicate or imply any affiliation, association, sponsorship or endorsement by any owners of such third party-owned trademarks.

You agree to each of the following:

a) The Content is only being provided as an aid to your own independent research and evaluation and you should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any Content.

b) The ability of the Website to interact with or the mentioning of any third-party wallet applications, devices, services, or products is not an endorsement or recommendation by or on behalf of Provider, and you assume all responsibility for selecting and evaluating, and incurring the risks of any bugs, defects, malfunctions or interruptions of any such applications, devices, operators, protocols, or networks.

c) You will not hold Provider (which includes Babylon Foundation) or any of its or their affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, members, employees, contractors, representatives or agents (collectively, ”Provider Parties”) liable for any damages that you may suffer in connection with your use of the Website or the Protocols.

d) The Content available on the Website is not professional, legal, business, investment, tax or any other advice related to any financial product, and are not intended for and must not be used as the basis of any investment decision.  

e) The Content available on the Website is not an offer or recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell any particular Digital Asset, security, or any other regulated financial product, and is not an offer or recommendation or solicitation to use any particular investment strategy.

f) Before you make any financial, legal, or other decision, you should seek independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.

g) These Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on any Provider Parties. The only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms.

h) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Provider Parties owe no fiduciary duties to you or any other party. To the extent any such duties may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated.

4. CERTAIN RISKS AND DISCLAIMERS

You acknowledge, agree to, and assume the following risks and matters:

a) Provider may discontinue all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without notice.

b) Provider has no obligation to ensure that the Website provide a complete and accurate source of all information relating to the Protocols or other blockchain information.

c) You may want or need to rely on block explorers, validator nodes, finality providers, or other third-party resources.

d) Provider is not registered or qualified with or licensed by, reports to, or is under the active supervision of any government agency or financial regulatory authority or organization. No government or regulator has approved or has been consulted by Provider regarding the accuracy or completeness of any information available on the Website. Similarly, the Protocols, technology, systems, blockchains, tokens, and persons relevant to information published on the Website may not be registered with or under the supervision of or be registered or qualified with or licensed by any government agency or financial regulatory authority or organization. Neither Provider nor any individual Website contributor is registered as a broker, dealer, advisor, transfer agent or other intermediary.

e) Digital Assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, carry significant risks that users must fully understand before engaging in any transactions. These risks include, but are not limited to, extreme price volatility, potential loss of access due to forgotten passwords or misplaced private keys, cybersecurity threats such as hacking or phishing, and the possibility of irreversible transactions. Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape for Digital Assets is complex and evolving, meaning that laws governing their use, taxation, and compliance obligations may change unexpectedly and vary by jurisdiction. Fraud, scams, and market manipulation are also prevalent concerns in the Digital Asset space. Given these risks, it is essential that users engage in extensive self-education, conduct thorough due diligence, and exercise caution before buying, selling, holding, or using Digital Assets. You should not invest or transact in Digital Assets unless you fully understand the technology, the market, and the potential consequences of your actions. If you are uncertain, seek advice from qualified professionals.

f) The Protocols, including Babylon Genesis, are developing decentralized protocols and the economic mechanisms described on the Website are subject to change based on decisions made by the larger community of builders and users. The Protocols rely upon third parties to adopt and implement software and protocols as users and contributors of the Protocols. They also rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to develop, supply and otherwise support them. There is no assurance or guarantee that such third parties will continue to participate in the Protocol or that the Protocol will continue to function as intended.

g) BABY, as the native token of Babylon Genesis, may be subject to the risks of the Babylon Genesis network, including: (i) the technology associated with Babylon Genesis may not function as intended; (ii) the details of the Babylon Genesis token economics including the total supply and distribution schedule may be changed due to decisions made by the consensus of participants of the Babylon Genesis network; (iii) Babylon Genesis may fail to attract sufficient interest from key stakeholders or users; (iv) Babylon Genesis may not progress satisfactorily and Babylon Genesis tokens may not be useful or valuable; (v) Babylon Genesis may suffer from attacks by hackers or other individuals; and (vi) Babylon Genesis is comprised of open-source technologies that depend on a network of computers that are not owned or controlled by Babylon Foundation to run certain software programs to process transactions.

h) Risks related to blockchain technology in general and Babylon Genesis in particular may impact the usefulness of Babylon Genesis, and, in turn, the utility or value of BABY. The software and hardware, technology and technical concepts and theories applicable to Babylon Genesis and BABY are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that Babylon Genesis will achieve any specific level of functionality or success, nor that the underlying technology will be uninterrupted or error-free, and there is an inherent risk that the technology could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, potentially, the complete loss of any Babylon Genesis tokens held by Babylon Genesis users.

i) As with most commonly used public blockchains, BABY is accessed using a private key that corresponds to the address at which they are stored. If the private key, or the "seed" used to create the address and corresponding private key are lost or stolen, the tokens associated with that address might be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.

j) Public blockchain-based systems may be vulnerable to attacks. These attacks, if successful, could result in the permanent loss of BABY.

k) Babylon Genesis, BABY, and blockchain technology are nascent, and there may be additional risks not described above or that may be new or unanticipated. 

5. NO WARRANTY, NO REPRESENTATIONS

The Website and Protocols are provided on an ”AS IS” and ”AS AVAILABLE” basis. Your access and use of the Website and Protocols are at your own risk. There is no representation or warranty that access to the Website or Protocols will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the information contained in the Website will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current, or that the Website or Protocols will be free from errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or statement made in connection with the Website or Protocols should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the Website or Protocols. There is no endorsement, guarantee, or assumption of responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Website or Protocols.

Further, there is no representations or warranty from anyone as to the quality, origin, or ownership of any Content found on or available through the Website or Protocols, and the Provider Parties will have no liability for any errors, misrepresentations, or omissions in, of, or about, the Content, nor for the availability of the Content, and they will not be liable for any losses, injuries, or damages from the use, inability to use, or the display of the Content.

7. PRIVACY POLICY

Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from users of the Website.

8. THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS AND CONTENT

References, links, or referrals to or connections with or reliance on third-party resources, products, services, or content, including smart contracts developed or operated by third parties, may be provided to users in connection with the Website. In addition, third parties may offer promotions. Provider does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any activities, resources, products, services, content, or promotions owned, controlled, operated, or sponsored by third parties, even when such third parties are our affiliates. If users access any such resources, products, services, or content or participate in any such promotions, users do so solely at their own risk. You hereby expressly waive and release Provider Parties from all liability arising from your use of any such resources, products, services, or content or participation in any such promotions.

We operate social media pages on third party networks and have social media icons. Social media providers are unaffiliated with us, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of social media providers. Social media providers have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies whenever you visit their websites or interact with their platforms.

Fork Handling

The Babylon Protocols including all native tokens may be subject to ”Forks” that occur when some or all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that: (i) changes the protocol rules in backward-compatible or backward-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or (ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some Forks may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original.

Provider cannot anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of Forks, and do not assume any risk, liability or obligation in connection therewith. Provider does not assume any responsibility to notify you of pending, threatened or completed Forks. Provider will respond (or refrain from responding) to any Forks in such manner as Provider determines in its sole and absolute discretion. Provider will not have any duty or obligation, or liability to any user if such response (or lack of such response) acts to your detriment. You assume full responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed about possible Forks, and to manage your own interests and risks in connection therewith.

9. TAX ISSUES

The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding, transferring, or locking Digital Assets or utilizing the Website are uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction. Provider has undertaken no due diligence or investigation into such tax consequences, and you assume all obligation and liability for the tax consequences applicable to you.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law, under no circumstances will any of the Provider Parties be responsible or liable under any theory of liability, whether based in tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise, for any damages of any kind arising from or relating to these Terms or the Website, including but not limited to direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages of any kind, including without limitation, loss of profits. The foregoing limitations apply even if any of the events or circumstances giving rise to such damages were foreseeable and even if the Provider Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages and notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.

Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law, if, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms, any of the Provider Parties is found to be liable to you for any damages or losses which arise from or relate to these Terms or the Website, the total aggregate liability of the Provider Parties for any and all such claims, regardless of the form of action, is limited to one hundred US dollars (US$100.00).

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities or damages. Accordingly, some disclaimers and limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply in full to you. However, the disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth in these Terms will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

11. INDEMNIFICATION

You will defend, indemnify, compensate, reimburse and hold harmless the Provider Parties from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to (a) Your access, interaction with, or other use, or use by anyone else you enable or permit, of or conduct in connection with the Website or Protocols; (b) your violation of these Terms or any other applicable policy or contract of Provider; or (c) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity; each, a ”Claim”. We may, in our sole discretion, require you to defend one or more Provider Parties in any Claim.

12. RESERVED.

13. PROMOTIONS

We may run various promotions, incentives, or giveaways (each, a ”Promotion”) communicated through official communication mediums, including blog posts, email, social media, and the Discord server. Applicable details, including any qualification periods, entry procedures or requirements, award or selection criteria (to be determined at our sole discretion), and notification procedures will be referenced there. Promotions are void where prohibited and open only to individuals who can lawfully participate in such Promotions in that individual's particular jurisdiction.

14. COPYRIGHT POLICY

A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
15. USER SUBMISSIONS, FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION

You acknowledge and agree that any submission, feedback, comments or suggestions you may provide regarding the Website either directly or indirectly (for example, through the use of a third-party social media site of a company-designated hashtag) (collectively, ”Feedback”) is non-confidential and non-proprietary, that we may treat as public information, and may be shared with others on other sites and platforms. You hereby grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, universe-wide, royalty-free right to use, communicate, reproduce, publish, display, distribute and exploit such Feedback in any manner, with the right to sublicense.

16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

Please read the arbitration provisions in this Section 16 of the Terms carefully (the “Arbitration Agreement”). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Babylon Foundation, its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the “Babylon Parties”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the Babylon Parties.

A. Informal Dispute Resolution:

There might be instances when a dispute arises between you and the Babylon Parties with respect to the Website or these Terms (“Dispute”). If that occurs, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution in good faith. Most Disputes can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing user support at legal@babylon.foundation (“Our Address”). However, if such efforts prove unsuccessful, you may send a written Notice of Dispute by email to Our Address (“Notice”). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the Dispute and set forth the specific relief sought.

If Babylon Foundation and you do not resolve the Dispute set out in the notice within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of receipt, you or Babylon Foundation may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both you and Babylon Foundation agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.

B. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement:

All unresolved disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to any of the Website, these Terms, or any other acts or omissions for which you may claim that that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any dispute, claim, or controversy as to arbitrability, will be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) under the LCIA Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the filing for arbitration of such dispute.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive termination of these Terms, the Website, or any connection you may have to the information you obtained from the Website.

C. Additional Terms of the Arbitration

The following terms apply to any Arbitration proceedings commenced under this Agreement:

The arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator, unless either party requests three arbitrators, in which case it will be held before three neutral arbitrators.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
The arbitration will be held in the Cayman Islands and the Cayman Islands will be deemed the 'seat of arbitration'.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
Any judgment or award made or rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary.
The parties will keep the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose any information regarding the arbitration to any third party except as follows. The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the ”Confidential Information”) will not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the ICC, the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration, or as necessary to enforce or challenge and award in bona fide legal proceedings, or as required by law. This confidentiality provision will survive termination of these Terms and of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.
D. Other Terms

If applicable law allows the enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement only if you have an opportunity to opt out of these arbitration provisions within a certain amount of time after you accept these Terms, then you have 30 days from your first use of any of the Website in which to opt out of such arbitration terms by sending an email to Our Address. This email should notify us that you wish to opt out and provide us with your full name, entity name if you have one, and jurisdiction.

We reserve the right to modify or update this Arbitration Agreement at any time. Any such changes will take effect immediately upon us posting the revised Agreement to the Website. If you do not agree with the changes, you may opt out within 30 days of the change by sending written notice to Our Address, otherwise, your continued use of the services will constitute your acceptance of the updated Arbitration Agreement.

To the extent you reject any future changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes).

E. Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver

You agree to bring all disputes or claims connected to the Website in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. Further, if any Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

Further, if for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration: (a) you and we irrevocably waive the right to demand a trial by jury, and (b) you and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Cayman Islands and any courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.

F. Exclusions

Notwithstanding the foregoing agreement to arbitrate, you or we may bring any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

17. GOVERNING LAW

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws. Except as expressly set forth in Section 16, ”Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes will be the courts located in the Cayman Islands, and you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

18. MISCELLANEOUS

The word ”or” as used in this Agreement has an inclusive meaning, equivalent to ”and/or”. The terms ‘include’ and ‘including’ will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase ”without limitation”. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. The word ”will” as used in this Agreement has its common meaning, as well as the meaning ascribed to the word ”shall”: expressing a current obligation or status, or obligation or status that will arise in the future. All provisions of these Terms are severable, and the unenforceability or invalidity of any of the provisions will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining provisions. Our failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver by us of any provision or any right we have to enforce these Terms. Any such waiver must be in writing in order to be effective. The parties declare that they have required that these Terms and all documents related hereto, either present or future, be drawn up in the English language only: Les parties déclarent par les présentes qu’elles exigent que cette entente et tous les documents y afferents, soit pour le present ou le future, soient rédigés en langue anglaise seulement.

The Provider Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries and have the right under The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2014 to directly enforce in their own right any rights or exclusions to which they are entitled under these Terms. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Provider as a result of these Terms or your use of the Website. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply and is expressly excluded.

If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, group, or association, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case the Terms ”you” or ”your” refers to you and such entity, group, or association. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms, you must not accept these Terms and you may not use the Website.

These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter of these Terms and the Privacy Policy, including the Website. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, supersede all prior terms, written or oral understandings, communications, and other agreements relating to the subject matter of these Terms and the Privacy Policy; provided, however, that if any provision of these Terms conflicts with any provision of any other contract you have entered into directly with us, the provision that is more protective of and beneficial to us will govern.
