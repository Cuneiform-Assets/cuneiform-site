Upon any such suspension, all rights and licenses granted to you under these Airdrop Terms will immediately terminate. In the event of any Force Majeure Event, breach of these Airdrop Terms, or any other event that would make the operation or provision of the Platform or related services commercially unreasonable for the Issuer Group, the Issuer Group may, in its discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice, suspend your access to all or a portion of the Platform. To the extent permitted under Applicable Law (including in the event of applicable legislation change or amendment), in the event the Issuer Group revokes your right to use or access the Platform, the Issuer Group shall not be required to provide you with any refund whatsoever.

14.9. Applicability of Securities Laws. References to the securities laws of any country or actions in compliance with such laws shall not be deemed an admission by the Issuer that the Tokens are subject to regulation as securities in any jurisdiction.

14.10. Entire Agreement. Unless otherwise provided, these Airdrop Terms are intended to fully reflect the terms of the agreement between the Parties and shall supersede any previously or contemporaneously agreed-upon terms or understanding; however, nothing in these Airdrop Terms are intended to nor will be read to modify, diminish, or supersede any provisions set forth in the any terms of use or services of any member of the Issuer Group that are more favorable or beneficial to der any other member of the Issuer Group. Under no circumstances will these Airdrop Terms modify, diminish, or supersede any terms or use of service of any of the Issuer Group that confers greater protection or benefit to the rights, limitations of liability, or remedies of any member of the Issuer Group. No provision of these Airdrop Terms shall be considered waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Party that benefits from the enforcement of such provision. No waiver of any provision in these Airdrop Terms, however, will be deemed a waiver of a subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of a similar provision. In addition, a waiver of any breach or a failure to enforce any term or condition of these Airdrop Terms will not in any way affect, limit, or waive a Party’s rights hereunder at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with every term and condition hereof.

14.11. Assignment. The Issuer may, at its sole and absolute discretion, assign any of its rights and/or delegate its duties under these Airdrop Terms (including, but not limited to, any and all intellectual property rights in or to all technology, software, and code relating to the Platform). You may not assign your rights or delegate your duties as a user of the Platform, or as a claimant of Tokens, and any assignment or delegation without the prior written consent of the Issuer, which the Issuer may withhold at its sole and absolute discretion, shall be null and void.

14.12. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions of these Airdrop Terms are for any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of these Airdrop Terms operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate these Airdrop Terms in any jurisdiction, then and in any such event, such provision(s) shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary so that such provision, as so modified, shall no longer be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable. Any such modification, invalidity, or unenforceability shall be strictly limited both to such provision and to such jurisdiction, and in each case to no other. Furthermore, in the event of any such modification, invalidity, or unenforceability, these Airdrop Terms shall be interpreted so as to achieve the intent expressed herein to the greatest extent possible in the jurisdiction in question and otherwise as set forth herein.

14.13. Electronic Notices and Use of Information. You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures (hereinafter - the “Communications”) that the Issuer Group provides in connection with your use of the Platform; and

The Issuer Group and their respective service providers may further disclose your information to any of their respective service providers, agents, relevant custodians, or similar third parties for any reason, and such Persons may keep your information for any period of time permitted by Applicable Law. You do hereby consent to such Persons disclosing any of your information which they hold to any Governmental Authority or prosecuting authority for any reason and without notice to you. You hereby acknowledge and agree to hold the Issuer Group harmless in respect of any disclosure of information by such Persons in accordance with these Airdrop Terms. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Issuer Group shall not be liable to you or any other Person for any loss, damage, or expense incurred directly or indirectly as a result of such disclosure.

14.14. Information Requests. The Issuer Group may determine, from time to time and in its sole and absolute discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you and your Affiliates in order to comply with Applicable Laws in connection with your entry into these Airdrop Terms and your subsequent holding of Tokens. You agree to provide the Issuer Group with such information promptly upon request, and you acknowledge and accept that the Issuer may refuse to accept your participation until you provide such requested information and the Issuer has determined that it is permissible for the Issuer to accept your participation under Applicable Law. The Issuer Group further reserves the right to request identification documentation from you and your Affiliates at any time. In the event that you or any such Affiliate does not provide such requested information to the satisfaction of the Issuer (in its sole and absolute discretion), the Issuer shall not be bound by the provisions of these Airdrop Terms and shall be entitled to specifically refuse any presentation of Tokens by you to the Issuer Group or any other Relevant Party. In the event that you, directly or indirectly, sell, assign, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of any Tokens, you do hereby covenant with the Issuer Group to procure that any such acquirer of Tokens shall be under equivalent obligations to provide such information to the Issuer Group at the request of the Issuer Group from time to time.

14.15. Tax Issues. The Issuer Group makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the distribution of Tokens or the possession or use of them. you bear the sole and absolute responsibility to determine if the claim of Tokens or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of Tokens over time has tax implications for you in your home jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction. By registering for the Airdrop and receiving Tokens, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, you agree to be solely responsible for any applicable taxes imposed on, and agree not to hold the Issuer Group liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from your registration, receipt, possession, or transfer of Tokens. All fees and charges payable by you to the Issuer are exclusive of any taxes, and shall certain taxes be applicable, they shall be added on top of the payable amounts. Upon the Issuer’s request, you will provide it any information it reasonably requests to determine whether it is obligated to collect any withholding taxes or value-added or similar or other taxes from you, including any applicable tax identification numbers. If any deduction or withholding is required by Applicable Law, you will notify the Issuer and will pay the Issuer any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that the Issuer receives, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount the Issuer would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide the Issuer with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority. To the extent the Issuer is responsible for remitting any withholding taxes or value-added or similar or other taxes, your allocation of Tokens shall be reduced to the extent such taxes are required to be remitted by the Issuer. The Issuer Group wishes to make you aware that future use of the Tokens by you when transacting with the Issuer Group may result in withholding taxes, value-added tax, and/or similar or other taxes being imposed. You will be responsible for such taxes; however, where the Issuer is responsible for remitting taxes, the amount of taxes shall be deducted from the fees otherwise due and payable by you in connection with your transactions with the Issuer.

14.16. Force Majeure Events. The Issuer Group shall not be liable for:

(1) any inaccuracy, error, delay in, or omission of:

(a) any information; or

(b) the transmission or delivery of information;

(2) any loss or damage arising from any event beyond the Issuer Group’s reasonable control, including but not limited to flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, pandemic, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of Governmental Authorities, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction or any other cause beyond the Issuer Group’s reasonable control (each, a “Force Majeure Event”).

14.17. Compliance Policies. The Issuer Group strictly follows applicable anti-money laundering (AML), “know your customer” (KYC), and other Applicable Laws in the British Virgin Islands. You fully agree to assist the Issuer Group in fulfilling the obligations of any Applicable Law and to provide any necessary information that is required from you to the Issuer Group or any relevant Governmental Authority.

14.18. Further Assistance. You shall cooperate with and assist the Issuer Group in connection with any investigation, examination, or inquiry by any Governmental Authority. You shall promptly provide the Issuer Group with any documents, certification, record, or other materials they may request in connection with such investigation, examination, or inquiry.

14.19. Limited Recourse. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Airdrop Terms, any obligations of the Issuer hereunder are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer payable solely from the Tokens (and in relation to the realization of any Tokens, the application of the proceeds thereof). All obligations of and any claims against the Issuer hereunder or in connection herewith after such realization shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive. No recourse shall be had against any officer, director, partner, employee, shareholder, or incorporator of the Issuer or its respective successors or assigns for any amounts payable in respect of the Tokens (except as otherwise provided herein).

14.20. Non-Petition. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Airdrop Terms, you may not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, the Issuer Group any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, winding-up, moratorium, or liquidation Proceedings, or other Proceedings under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, U.S. federal or state bankruptcy or similar laws. Nothing in this Clause 14.20 shall preclude, or be deemed to stop, you:

(i) from taking any action in:

(A) any case or Proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by the Issuer; or

(B) any involuntary insolvency Proceeding filed or commenced by a Person other than you; or

(ii) from commencing against the Issuer any legal action which is not a bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium, or liquidation Proceeding.

14.21. Interpretation. Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe any provisions of these Airdrop Terms. The word “or” as used in this Airdrop Terms has an inclusive meaning, equivalent to “and/or”. The terms ‘include’ and ‘including’ will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase “without limitation”. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in these Airdrop Terms have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret these Airdrop Terms. The word “will” as used in these Airdrop Terms has its common meaning, as well as the meaning ascribed to the word “shall”: expressing a current obligation or status, or obligation or status that will arise in the future. All provisions of these Airdrop Terms are severable, and the unenforceability or invalidity of any of the provisions will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining provisions. Our failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Airdrop Terms shall not be deemed a waiver by us of any provision or any right we have to enforce these Airdrop Terms. Any such waiver must be in writing in order to be effective. The parties declare that they have required that these Airdrop Terms and all documents related hereto, either present or future, be drawn up in the English language only.

Intellectual Property Notification: This document belongs to the Issuer and is protected by copyright laws. Its copying and/or use by any third party in full or in part without prior written consent of the Issuer is strictly prohibited.

SCHEDULE 2

RISK DISCLOSURES: CERTAIN RISK FACTORS

ACQUIRING TOKENS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. PROSPECTIVE CLAIMANTS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS DESCRIBED HEREIN, TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE AIRDROP TERMS AND THE INFORMATION MATERIALS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION TO REGISTER FOR THE AIRDROP OR RECEIVE TOKENS. THE FOLLOWING RISKS ENTAIL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER GROUP COULD SUFFER. THE FOLLOWING IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS RISK FACTORS. NO MEMBER OF THE ISSUER GROUP OWNS, OPERATES, OR CONTROLS THE PLATFORM OR THE PLATFORM OPERATOR.

OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT HEREIN, THE ISSUER SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT REPRESENT AND WARRANT AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMATION MATERIALS, THE PLATFORM, AND THE TOKENS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SUITABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR AS TO THE WORKMANSHIP OR TECHNICAL CODING THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. THE ISSUER DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TOKENS OR THE PLATFORM ARE RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE, MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE TOKENS OR THE PLATFORM WILL BE CORRECTED. THE ISSUER CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE TOKENS, THE PLATFORM, OR THE DELIVERY MECHANISM FOR THE TOKENS IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

The precise terms of the privileges and other benefits of the Tokens will be determined by parties other than you from time to time. Such privileges and benefits may be amended thereafter at any time and without notice to, or consent from, any holder or group of holders of Tokens, or the Issuer. Any such determination or amendment shall not be a breach of the terms of the Tokens.

While the Tokens are available only to claimants that are not Prohibited Persons (which therefore excludes claims by U.S. Persons), there is the possibility that Tokens could be acquired over time or following changes in the regulatory landscape by U.S. Persons and/or persons in other jurisdictions currently restricted from acquiring Tokens, and, accordingly, the risk factors set out below may include certain risk factors specific to certain jurisdictions even though the Issuer will not at present make the Tokens available at this time to persons from such jurisdictions.

Nothing herein prevents new cryptographic tokens that are interoperable with the Platform from being developed and distributed in the future.

The Platform, while not owned, operated, developed, or otherwise controlled by the Issuer, is in beta stage, which means that the Platform and all related software are experimental. The Platform is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any representation or warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, any representations or warranties that the Platform is free of defects, vulnerabilities, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, or non-infringing. Any use of the Platform shall be at your own risk. In no event shall the Issuer Group or the owner of the Platform be held liable in connection with or for any claims, losses, damages, or other liabilities, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with the Platform or its operation or use or be under any obligation to support, develop, or otherwise maintain or promote the use of the Platform or the integration of the Tokens into the Platform.

No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to the Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value.

BY PARTICIPATING IN ANY REGISTRATION OR RECEIPT OF TOKENS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME ALL RISKS RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THE RISKS SET OUT BELOW.

a. Reliance on Developers:

The Issuer may enter into one or more service agreements pursuant to which one or more software developers (each a “Developer”) will provide services with respect to the Issuer’s development and distribution of the Tokens. As consideration for each such Developer providing those services, the Issuer may agree to issue the Developer with a significant number of Tokens. The Director of the Issuer believes that the provisions of each such services agreement will reflect commercial arm’s-length dealings between the Issuer and each such Developer, although there is a material risk that the Tokens are never created, or are never suitably integrated into the Platform, in the event that the Issuer is unable to retain suitable Developers for an ongoing period of time.

b. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Wallet Incompatibility:

Your cryptocurrency wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the receipt, storage, and transfer of the Tokens. Non-compatible wallet addresses will not be accepted. In addition, your wallet address must not be associated with a third-party exchange or service that has custody over the private key. You must own the private key if your address is an exchange address. The Issuer reserves the right to prescribe additional conditions relating to specific wallet requirements at any time, acting in its sole discretion.

c. Risks Associated with the Blockchain Protocols:

Any malfunction, breakdown, abandonment, unintended function, unexpected functioning of, or attack on the protocol upon which the Tokens are issued may have an adverse effect on the Tokens, including causing them to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.

d. Risks Associated with your Credentials:

Any third party that gains access to or learns of your wallet login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of your Tokens. To minimize this risk, you should guard against unauthorized access to your electronic devices. Best practices dictate that you safely store private keys in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location. In addition, you are responsible for giving us the correct wallet address to which to send your Tokens. If you give us the incorrect address to which to send your Tokens, we are not responsible for any loss of Tokens that may occur.

e. Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions:

i. Cryptographic Technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction, and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology-based applications, which regulations may be contrary to the current setup of the Platform or its smart contract system and, therefore, may result in substantial modifications to the Platform and such smart contract systems, including its termination and the loss of Tokens.

ii. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) the Platform and Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) the Platform and Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platform and Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration, licensing, or restriction. The Issuer may cease operations in a jurisdiction if regulatory actions, or changes to Applicable Laws, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. The functioning of the Platform and the Tokens could be impacted by any regulatory inquiries or actions, including restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like the Tokens, which restrictions could impede, limit, or end the development of the Platform and increase legal costs.

iii. The cryptocurrency exchange market, the token listing and trading market, and by extension the Platform, are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to “know your customer” and “anti-money laundering” and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Platform could be enacted, which could impact the utility of the Tokens in the Platform. Additionally, users of the Platform are subject to or may be adversely affected by industry-specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other Applicable Laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the Platform and the Tokens, including the utility of Tokens with respect to the Platform.

f. Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Platforms:

Following the distribution of the Tokens and the continued development of the Platform, it is possible that alternative applications or platforms could be established, which use the same or similar open-source code and protocol underlying the Platform. The Tokens may have no intrinsic value with respect to such alternative applications. The Platform may compete with these alternative, unofficial token-based applications, which could potentially negatively impact the Platform and the Tokens.

g. Token Generation Risk and Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform:

There are no guarantees as to the timing of the Tokens being integrated into the Platform, which is dependent on many factors, including many outside the Issuer’s control. The Platform is not owned, operated, or controlled by the Issuer. Further, it is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations, and that there will be limited public interest in the Platform. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact the Tokens and the Platform.

h. Diverse Use of Digital Assets; Decreased Adoption:

As a new asset and technological innovation, the digital asset industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and digital assets are used by market participants for various purposes. Tokens created and disseminated with respect to the Platform may be intended to be used in connection with a specific service or product developed by the Platform. However, there is no guarantee that holders of Tokens will continue to use Tokens for such purposes or that any Token will maintain its value in the long term. A lack of expansion, or a decrease, in usage of the Token could adversely impact the short-term or long-term value of the Token.

i. No Operating History:

The Issuer has no operating history and will be operating in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing the business and future prospects of the Issuer and the Platform Operator is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties the Issuer and the Platform Operator may encounter. These risks and difficulties include, but are not limited to, their ability to:

Navigate complex and evolving regulatory and competitive environments;
Obtain the requisite regulatory and other licenses in the relevant jurisdictions;
Obtain and retain customers;
Successfully develop, maintain, and update internal controls to manage compliance within an evolving and complex regulatory environment;
Effectively identify and react to market trends;
Be involved in the successful development and deployment of the Platform;
Implement new products and services;
Successfully execute the Issuer’s funding strategy;
Effectively compete with other companies;
Successfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the market;
Effectively manage the growth of the business;
Continue to develop, maintain, and scale the Platform;
Effectively use finite personnel and technology resources;
Effectively maintain and scale financial and risk management controls and procedures;
Maintain the security of technology infrastructure, and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized therein; and
Attract, integrate, and retain qualified employees and contractors.
j. Risk that the Platform, as Developed, Will Not Meet Expectations:

The Platform presently is under continued development by the Platform Operator and may undergo significant changes. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and functionality of the Platform or the Tokens (including participant behavior) held by the owner of the Platform, the Issuer, or you may not be met, for any number of reasons, including, without limitation, mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation plans, and changes in the execution of the Platform. Moreover, the Issuer may not be able to retain full and effective control over how other participants will use the Platform, what products or services will be offered through the Platform by third parties, or how third-party products and services will utilize Tokens (if at all). This could create the risk that the Tokens or Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations. Furthermore, it is possible that the Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately maintained, which may negatively impact the Platform and Tokens, and the potential utility of the Tokens.

k. Litigation and Third-Party Claims May Adversely Affect the Development and Adoption of the Platform:

From time to time, third parties may assert claims against the Issuer, its developers, and/or its underlying technology. Regardless of the merit of any legal action or claim, any action that reduces confidence in the Issuer’s long-term viability or the ability of individuals to hold and transfer Tokens may adversely affect the Platform. Additionally, a meritorious claim could prevent developers from accessing the most up-to-date Platform code or holding or transferring their Tokens.

l. The Value of the Tokens Will Be Affected by the Success of the Platform:

Because the Tokens are intended for use on the Platform, a failure by the owner of the Platform to successfully develop and/or maintain the Platform would negatively affect the value of the Tokens. There is no guarantee that the Platform will develop as planned or become successful in the marketplace.

m. Long-Term Viability of Cryptoassets:

Cryptoassets, including those like the Tokens, are a new and relatively untested product. There is considerable uncertainty about their long-term viability, which could be affected by a variety of factors, including many market-based factors such as economic growth, inflation, and others. In addition, the success of cryptoassets (including the Tokens) will depend on the long-term utility and economic viability of Cryptographic Technologies. Due in part to these uncertainties, the price of cryptoassets is volatile, and the Tokens may be hard to sell. The Issuer does not control any of these factors and therefore may not be able to control the ability of the Tokens to maintain their value over time.

n. Further Innovations in the Cryptoasset Industry May Cause the Tokens to Lose Value:

The development and acceptance of the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of, and transactions in, cryptoassets is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate and predict. The use of cryptoassets to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services is part of a new and rapidly evolving commercial practice that employs digital assets based on a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The growth of this commercial practice in general, and the use of cryptoassets in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Factors affecting further development of the cryptoasset industry include, among other things, the continued worldwide adoption of cryptoassets; governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptoassets and/or cryptoasset exchanges; changing consumer demographics, tastes, and preferences; sustained development and maintenance of open-source software protocols; the popularity and availability of alternative and/or new payment services; and general economic conditions. If these factors negatively affect or impede the development of the cryptoasset industry, the value of your Tokens may also be negatively affected.

o. Inability to Fund Development or Maintenance:

The Issuer may not be able to fund development of the Tokens, while the owner of the Platform may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it was intended.

p. Risks from Taxation:

The tax characterization of the Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquiring and holding Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. An investment in the Tokens may result in adverse tax consequences, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. Additionally, subsequent transactions in cryptoassets such as the Tokens may cause investors to incur tax liabilities. Further, any reward received in the form of, or through the use of, Tokens may result in additional tax liability. Each investor should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors.

q. Risk of Theft and Hacking:

i. Smart contracts, software applications, and the Platform may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals, groups, organizations, or countries that interfere with the Platform or the availability of the Tokens in any number of ways, including denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks, or phishing, or other novel methods that may or may not be known. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of Tokens, adversely impacting the ability to further develop the Platform and/or related platforms and derive any usage or functionality from Tokens. You must take appropriate steps to satisfy yourself of the integrity and veracity of relevant websites, systems, and communications. Furthermore, because the Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Issuer’s team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the Platform, which could negatively affect the Platform and Tokens.

ii. You acknowledge, understand, and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the Tokens associated with your wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to your wallet, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens, for which the Issuer shall have no liability.

r. Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Platform:

The Platform consists, at least in part, of open-source software that may be based on other open-source software. There is a risk that the Issuer or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Platform, interfering with the use of or causing the loss of Tokens.

s. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography:

Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Platform protocol by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Platform protocol, which could result in the theft, loss, or decreased utility of the Tokens. Smart contracts, blockchain application software, and blockchain platforms and protocols are still in an early development stage and relatively unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free, and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses, or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or Tokens.

t. Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Platform:

While the Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time. That value may be limited or non-existent if the Platform lacks acceptance, use, and adoption, which may have an adverse impact on the Tokens.

u. Risk of an Illiquid Market for Tokens:

There may never be any marketplace for Tokens. There are currently no exchanges upon which the Tokens would trade. If exchanges do develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may, therefore, be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative impact on the Tokens. To the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If (despite your representations to us to the contrary) You are holding Tokens as a form of investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic, or cash-equivalent value may increase with time. You assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that the Tokens are not offered by the Issuer Group on an investment basis. Holders of Tokens should be prepared to hold their Tokens indefinitely, as there is no guarantee that holders will be able to transfer, sell, or exchange their Tokens or otherwise redeem them as currency if adoption of the Platform is limited or unsuccessful. Further, we make no representations as to the future market price of Tokens and no representations that the price per Token determined by a future market will be equal to or higher than any purchase price or value.

v. Risk of Dissolution of the Platform:

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including development issues with the Platform, the failure of business relationships, lack of public interest, lack of funding, or competing intellectual property claims, the Platform may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to maintain commercial or legal viability, or be abandoned. There is no assurance that you will receive any benefits through the Tokens.

w. Risk of Malfunction in the Platform:

It is possible that the Platform malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including one that results in the loss of the Tokens.

x. Risk Arising from Lack of Governance Rights:

To the extent the Tokens confer no governance functionality or only limited governance rights with respect to the Platform, substantially all decisions involving the Platform including, but not limited to, decisions by the Platform Operator to discontinue the Platform, can be made those with such governance capabilities. These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and/or Tokens you hold.

y. Risks Associated with Incomplete Information Regarding the Tokens and the Platform:

You will not have full access to all the information relevant to the Issuer, the Tokens, and/or the Platform. Neither the Issuer nor the Platform Operator is required to update you on the progress of the Platform. You are responsible for making your own decision in respect of the acquisition of the Tokens. The Issuer does not provide you with any recommendation or advice in respect of the acquisition of the Tokens. You may not rely on the Issuer to provide you with complete or up-to-date information.

z. No Fiduciary Relationship:

The holders of Tokens will not be in any fiduciary, partnership, trustee, agency, or similar relationship with the Issuer Group and will not be owed any fiduciary duty by the Issuer Group. The holders of Tokens have no direct management, equity, voting, or similar rights in the Issuer Group. However, without limitation to the above, the Issuer reserves all rights with respect to pursuing any form of decentralized governance should it so determine that doing so would be in the best interests of the holders of Tokens from time to time.

aa. Changes to Token and Platform for Legal Compliance:

In order to seek compliance with (or to seek to mitigate the impact of) any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, injunctions, orders, treaties, sanctions, administrative acts, or decrees of any nation or Governmental Authority, any state or other political subdivision thereof, any entity exercising legislative, judicial, or administrative functions of or pertaining to government, including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority, agency, department, board, commission, or instrumentality, and any court, tribunal, or arbitrator(s) of competent jurisdiction, and any self-regulatory organization believed by the Issuer Group to apply to or affect the Issuer Group, the Platform, or the Tokens, the Issuer may in its sole and absolute discretion take such steps as it considers necessary or convenient to comply with such matters including, without limitation, the termination of the Tokens and/or the Platform. In addition, the Issuer may take such steps as it considers necessary or convenient where it believes or suspects the Tokens may be used, trafficked, or applied in the attempted furtherance of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, or other unlawful activity, or where it believes the Platform is no longer viable.

bb. Regulation Risk:

Regulation of Cryptographic Technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently underdeveloped and is likely to evolve rapidly, vary significantly among international, national, federal, state, and local jurisdictions, and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States, South Korea, China, Singapore, among other countries, are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Platform, the Issuer, and the Tokens. Other countries may adopt similar approaches. Failure by the Issuer or users of the Platform to comply with any laws, rules, and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations would likely have numerous material adverse consequences on the Issuer, the Platform, and/or the Tokens. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have a material adverse impact on the value of the Tokens or impede the activities of the Issuer or the Platform.

cc. Representation by Legal Counsel:

The legal counsel representing the issuer as to matters of BVI law does not represent any current or prospective investors with respect to an investment in the Tokens. No separate counsel has been engaged by the Issuer to represent any current or prospective investors with respect to an investment in the Tokens. The existing counsel may be removed as counsel by the Issuer at any time without the consent of, or notice to, investors. In addition, the existing counsel does not undertake on behalf of or for the benefit of investors to monitor the compliance of the Issuer with applicable laws.

dd. The Issuer Has the Exclusive Right, in Its Sole and Absolute Discretion, to Address and Remediate Any of the Operational, Legal, or Regulatory Risks Presented as of the Date Hereof or Hereafter:

In the exercise of such rights, it is possible that the Issuer may determine that the continued development of the Platform is not feasible. Accordingly, there is a material risk that the Issuer Group may not successfully continue to develop, market, and operate the Platform and the Tokens.

ee. Risk of Abandonment / Lack of Success:

The Tokens and Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, funding, commercial success or prospects (e.g., caused by competitors). There is no assurance that, even if the Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any benefits through the Tokens.

ff. Risk Associated with Markets for Tokens:

Any value which anyone ascribe to the Tokens may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. You should not seek to acquire Tokens as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, or with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic, or cash-equivalent value may increase with time. You assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that the Tokens are not offered on an investment basis. You further acknowledge that any funds you consider to be invested in the Tokens will not be protected, guaranteed, or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory, or other entity.

gg. Unanticipated Risks:

Cryptographic Technologies are a relatively new and comparatively untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed herein, there are risks that the Issuer cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.
